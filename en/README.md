Ramayana_Book
=============

**Introduction:**
NASH

Book about Ramayana ( One of the two great epics of Hinduism ) ascribed by Valmiki

The Ramayana consists of 24,000 verses in seven books (kāṇḍas) and 500 cantos (sargas)

Ramayana tells the story of Rama (an avatar of the Hindu supreme-god Vishnu), whose wife Sita is abducted by Ravana, the king of Lanka (current day Sri Lanka). Thematically, the Ramayana explores human values and the concept of dharma.

The seven kandas (books or maybe chapters or phases) of Ramayana are as follows:

  - Bāla Kāṇḍa (Book of childhood)
  - Ayodhya Kāṇḍa (Book of ayodhya)3
  - Araṇya Kāṇḍa (Book of the forest)
  - Kishkindha Kāṇḍa (Book of the monkey kingdom)
  - Sundara Kāṇḍa (Book of beauty)
  - Yuddha Kāṇḍa (Book of war, also known as Lanka Kanda)
  - Uttara Kāṇḍa (Last book)

**Development**

I/we would like to create a portable version of epic Ramayana in any format (html,pdf,word etc) to preserve one of the best books ever written in hindu mythology.

We would appreciate if anyone could provide good resources to start.
